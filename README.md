# Customer-Churn

## In this Project I have analysed what causes Customer Churn in a company and what vairables causes these unfortunate events.

First before Modelling and predicting whether the customers will churn or not, I did some Exploration of the data set and found some insights which are interesting.

## The churn is higher when the Monthly Charges are higher!

## It's surprising to see that the churn is higher when the total charges are lower

When we combine the following 3 aspects this picture will be a bit clear.
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges

This could be because the higher monthly charge at a lower tenure will result in lower total charge.

### Bad service offerings such as minimal tech support or no security can lead to have a high churn rate than others.

##After some Bivariate Analysis we find how multiple factors lead to Customer Churn.


When analysing if at all the payment methods do cause customers to churn? We find our answer here that payments via electronic check leads to high churn rate.

The duration of the contract to which the customers are tied down to plays a significant role as we can visualize that the customers who are not into contract with the company are likely to churn faster than the ones that are and these could be several reason that affect their decision making.

The churn amongst Senior Citizens is quite high given the ratio. Although most of our group are not senior citizens the churn rate in both the groups seems quite high and perhaps more justification is required for this purpose.
